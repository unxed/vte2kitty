# Test Harness for kitty keyboard protocol implementation in various VTs

This project is a specialized testing infrastructure designed to verify the implementation of the **kitty keyboard protocol** within **GNOME VTE**.

It works by extracting the core key encoding logic from both the **kitty** source code (the reference implementation) and the **GNOME VTE** source code (the target implementation), wrapping them in isolated mock environments, and running a comprehensive differential test suite against thousands of key combinations.

```

In addition to GNOME VTE, the project includes tests for the built-in terminal of the far2l file manager, as well as for the Alacritty terminal. These examples clearly illustrate the possibilities of testing code written in different languages and with different internal architectures: for example, far2l uses the Windows event model with KEY_EVENT_RECORD (which does not support distinguishing between shifted and unshifted fields — note how I worked around this issue if you encounter a similar one), while Alacritty, unlike GNOME VTE and far2l, is written in Rust. These examples should help you if you decide to write an adaptation of this mini-framework for testing any terminal developed for any platform.

### far2l note

Since we have no information about keyboard layouts in far2l, we cannot implement a distinction between shifted and unshifted fields as required by the kitty kb protocol specification. Fortunately, a compromise is possible here, [approved](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/8620#issuecomment-2878530117) by the author of the specification. Therefore, in the tests I use hardcoded conversion tables for shifted and unshifted values for the English keyboard layout, and a compromise approach for all other cases. This seems like the lesser evil and allows to achieve maximum test coverage.

## Setup & Prerequisites

### Dependencies
You need a standard C/C++ build environment and `libxkbcommon` development headers.
*   **Debian/Ubuntu:** `sudo apt install build-essential libxkbcommon-dev pkg-config`
*   **Fedora:** `sudo dnf install @development-tools libxkbcommon-devel`

### Preparing Source Files
This harness does not include the original source code. You must copy the relevant files from your GNOME VTE and kitty repositories into the `source/` directory:

1.  Copy `kitty/key_encoding.c` from the kitty repo to `source/key_encoding.c`.
2.  Copy `src/vte.cc` from your modified GNOME VTE repo to `source/vte.cc`.
3.  ...do the same for all supported terminals. See `source/get_samples.sh` to know what files do you actually need and where to find them.

## Usage

1.  **Build the testers:**
    Run `make` in the root directory. This will:
    *   Extract the relevant code snippets from the files in `source/`.
    *   Compile the isolated testers against their mock headers.
    *   Generate binaries in `build/bin/`.

    ```bash
    make clean && make
    ```

2.  **Run the test suite:**
    Run the Python script to generate key combinations and compare outputs.
    For example, to run all tests for alacritty terminal:

    ```bash
    python3 run_tests.py --target alacritty
    ```

    **Options:**
    *   `--target [vte|far2l|alacritty]`: Select the implementation to test (default: `vte`).
    *   `--start-at-percent`: Start tests from a certain percentage (0-99).
    *   `--limit N`: Run only the first N tests (useful for quick checks).
    *   `--debug`: Print the exact commands being executed and their stderr output.

3.  **Analyze Results:**
    *   **Console:** Shows progress and a summary.
    *   **`mismatches.log`**: Contains a human-readable diff of every case where kitty and the target implementation disagreed.
    *   **`test_results.json`**: Contains the raw data for all tests.

## Generating Golden Rules

If you need to generate a reference file containing the expected output from the official kitty implementation for every possible key combination (without running comparisons against other terminals), you can use the `--generate-golden` flag.

```bash
python3 run_tests.py --generate-golden golden_rules.txt
```

This will run the `kitty_tester` against all defined combinations and save the output to `golden_rules.txt`.

**File Format:**
Each line represents one test case in the format:
`INPUT_ARGS | FLAGS | OUTPUT`

*   **INPUT_ARGS**: The command line arguments passed to the tester (e.g., `--key a --ctrl`).
*   **FLAGS**: The integer value of the kitty keyboard flags.
*   **OUTPUT**: The resulting escape sequence (with `ESC` representing the `\x1b` byte) or `[EMPTY]`.

**Example:**
```text
--key a --ctrl | 1 | ESC[1;5a
--key F1 | 2 | ESC[1;2P
--key kp_0 --num | 0 | 0
```

## Design Rationale

This testing infrastructure was built based on specific constraints and lessons learned from previous attempts. Here is why it is built the way it is:

### 1. Why Code Extraction?
Linking against the full `libvte` or building the full `kitty` binary is overkill and introduces massive dependencies (GTK, Wayland/X11, GLib event loops, Python runtime for kitty).
*   **Decision:** We extract *only* the specific C/C++ functions responsible for translating key events into escape sequences (`encode_glfw_key_event` in kitty and `widget_key_press` logic in GNOME VTE).
*   **Result:** The resulting test binaries are tiny, compile instantly, and have almost no runtime overhead.

### 2. Why Mocking?
Early attempts using tools like `xdotool`, `send_key`, or `xtest` to send events to a running terminal window were unreliable.
*   **Problem:** Very slow, focus stealing, race conditions, and the overhead of the display server made tests flaky and slow. Also, some xtest'ed key combinations may log you out, send you to the kernel console or burn your house. Also, GTK ignores "synthetic" keyboard events completely.
*   **Decision:** We mock the environment. We created `kitty_mocks.h` and `vte_key_tester.h` to emulate the necessary structs (`GLFWkeyevent`, `GdkEventKey`) and constants.
*   **Result:** The tests run in a "headless" CLI environment. They are deterministic, reproducible, and extremely fast (thousands of checks per second).
